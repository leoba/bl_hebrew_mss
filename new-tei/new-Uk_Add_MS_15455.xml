            <note>Folios 1-4 are parchment leaves of the 12th century, containing a portion of Homily IV of St. Chrysostom on Isaiah 6:1. Folio 5 is a paper flyleaf of the 17th to 18th century (partly folded), and contains a short piece in Hebrew dealing with the plague, followed by two pieces in Turkish (in Hebrew characters) on the same subject. Folios 6-8: notes and scribblings, partly illegible. Shelomoh Martin, perhaps a former owner, mentioned in two entries in connection with money transactions. Folios 1v-3v and 6r-8v, margins: a Hebrew-Turkish vocabulary, apparently of the 17th century. </note>
