									Quires of originally 10 leaves each, now incomplete, marked with Arabic words on the left-hand upper corners of the first page (signatures mostly not preserved).
									The first two quires, together with the first leaf of the third quire, are missing. 
									Folios 1-9 are the remaining 9 leaves of the third quire; folios 10-29 form two complete quires of 10 leaves each, marked on the left-hand upper corners of folios 10 and 20 respectively.
									Of the 6th quire only the first leaf and the last are preserved (folios 30-31); the same with the 7th quire.
									Folios 34-42 are the remaining leaves of the 8th quire.
