                  <provenance>Acquisition: The Harley Collection, formed by Robert
                           Harley (b. 1661, d. 1724), 1st earl of Oxford and Mortimer,
                        politician, and Edward Harley (b.
                        1689, d. 1741), 2nd earl of Oxford and Mortimer, book collector and patron
                        of the arts. Edward Harley bequeathed the library to his widow, Henrietta Cavendish, née Holles (b.
                        1694, d. 1755) during her lifetime and thereafter to their daughter, Margaret Cavendish Bentinck (b. 1715,
                        d.1785), duchess of Portland; the manuscripts were sold by the Countess and
                        the Duchess in 1753 to the nation for £10,000 (a fraction of their
                        contemporary value) under the Act of Parliament that also established the
                        British Museum; the Harley manuscripts form one of the foundation
                        collections of the British Library.</provenance>
