The first watermark is a hand, the second watermark is a vase with a crescent at the top and a monogramm (CO?), similar to 3603 (dated to 1646, England).Single leaves were written by another scribe; their codicological elements being different from those by the original scribe. At the bottom of these pages, one can discern the scribe's attempts to enlarge the letters in order to fit the text into the remaining empty spaces. These leaves were glued into the margins of now-missing pages which were torn out from the original Pentateuch.</p>

                     <scriptNote>Ashkenazi square and semi-cursive script, partially punctuated.		Avraham ben Yitsḥaḳ: inscribed with his name in two colophons and an additional scribal formula: 'Grow stronger and let us grow stronger. May no harm befall on Abraham [ben ha-ḳadosh rabi Yitsḥaḳ] the copyist not today and not ever until the donkey ascends the ladder to the heavens about which our father Yaʿaḳov had dreamed' [English translation], 14th century (219r, 288r, 307r); the name Avram and Avraham is decorated several times, (e.g. 14r, 21r, 141v, 186r, 307r). Yaʿaḳov: inscribed with his name on folio 230r: may the owner of the book have eternal life for volunteering to write the missing pages.  It appears that Yaʿaḳov acquired the Pentateuch with a few of its pages missing and he himself filled in the missing gaps.

                  <provenance>Acquisition: The Harley Collection, formed by Robert Harley (b. 1661, d. 1724), 1st earl of Oxford and Mortimer, politician, and Edward Harley (b. 1689, d. 1741), 2nd earl of Oxford and Mortimer, book collector and patron of the arts.
Edward Harley bequeathed the library to his widow, Henrietta Cavendish, née Holles (b. 1694, d. 1755) during her lifetime and thereafter to their daughter, Margaret Cavendish Bentinck (b. 1715, d.1785), duchess of Portland; the manuscripts were sold by the Countess and the Duchess in 1753 to the nation for £10,000 (a fraction of their contemporary value) under the Act of Parliament that also established the British Museum; the Harley manuscripts form one of the foundation collections of the British Library.</provenance>
