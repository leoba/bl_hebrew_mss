The writing stands a little below the ruled line.The mishnah of each chapter is not divided into small sections as in printed editions of the Talmud, but is given in entirety before the gemara begins. Each chapter of the Mishnah ends with the phrase: סליק פרקא, and a few words of the mishnah are repeated as a heading to the gemara that treats on that part.Each chapter of the Gemara ends with: הדרן עלך.Each tractate ends with: סליקא מסכת.Folios 23r, 71r are left blank due to the fact that folio 23 and 71 respectively begin fresh quires written by different hands from the portions which in each case precede them, so that a new scribe began a new tractate. The concluding portions of the preceding tractates have been left out.</p>

                  <provenance>Acquisition: The Harley Collection, formed by Robert Harley (b. 1661, d. 1724), 1st earl of Oxford and Mortimer, politician, and Edward Harley (b. 1689, d. 1741), 2nd earl of Oxford and Mortimer, book collector and patron of the arts.  Edward Harley bequeathed the library to his widow, Henrietta Cavendish, née Holles (b. 1694, d. 1755) during her lifetime and thereafter to their daughter, Margaret Cavendish Bentinck(b. 1715, d.1785), duchess of Portland; the manuscripts were sold by the Countess and the Duchess in 1753 to the nation for £10,000 (a fraction of their contemporary value) under the Act of Parliament that also established the British Museum; the Harley manuscripts form one of the foundation collections of the British Library. </provenance>
